Always on a hunt
Always on a hunt. My name is Timi and I'm working on tech roles in EU as a Sr. Recruiter. #freelancerules I'm always trying to find a way to speak the same language with developers. Still, I'm recruiter and nope, I can't code yet. I know the difference between Javascript and Java. :) So if you find this and would like to have a chat about the opportunites I have in my "pocket", ping me on timea@dttrecruitment.hu (no website, its just a hosted thing to have a professional email address).

I feel like a castaway human being - sending messages in a bottle - hoping for someone to read it.
